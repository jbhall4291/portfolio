        <br></br>As a keen learner and outgoing individual, I am thrilled to
        bring my skills to the industry following my recent graduation from the
        Northcoders Software Developer bootcamp. Throughout the bootcamp, I
        acquired numerous skills and developed a diverse portfolio of projects,
        which you can find out more about below.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Of course I'm now eager to apply my skills in the real-world and
        contribute to a company's success so, if you have any suitable
        opportunities, or want to learn more about me then get in touch!
